                /* Now a question may arise then when to use 'for' loops and when to use 'while' loops.
                * The answer is pretty simple and it is, when you know that how many times the loops is
                * going to execute, then use 'for' loops, and when you don't know that how many times the loop
                * is going to execute, then use 'while' loops
                *
                * For example: just suppose you have to print first 'n' integers, then in this case you know
                * that how many times the loops gonna run, so in this case you should use 'for' loops.
                *
                * on the other hand just suppose you have to make a program which must continuously take an integer input from
                * the user until unless the user provides an input apart from an integer say char or string, so in this
                * case you don't know that how many times the loop gonna execute so in this case you should use
                * 'while' loops.   As simple as that ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š*/
